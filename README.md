Tube geometry by Vitaliy Maslikov for Udacity 3D graphics contest
License CC BY 3.0

Features:
-rounded tube ends
-radius of the tube can be modified with a function. As you can see in the screenshots it allows to generate objects like vases, goblets and so on
adjustable outer/inner heights and radiuses

I also coded a function to display vertex and face normals of generated geometry (they can be turned on in “Display parameters” tab of the demo).
